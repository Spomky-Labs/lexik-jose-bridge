This Symfony Bundle provides a JWT Encoder for the [LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle) that uses the [web-token/jwt-framework](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-framework) as JWT Creator/Loader.

# The Release Process

The release process [is described here](Resources/doc/Release.md).

# Prerequisites

This library needs at least:
* ![PHP 7.1+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.1%2B-ff69b4.svg)
* Symfony 3.3+ or 4.0+.

# Continuous Integration

It has been successfully tested using `PHP 7.1` and `PHP 7.2` and `nightly`.

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Spomky-Labs/lexik-jose-bridge) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/b351c9ca-b49f-4f22-925a-8e0cab6b8cb2).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/61054893).

Code coverage is not performed, but `Behavior driven development` (BDD) is used to test this bundle. 

# Installation


## Symfony Flex

The preferred way to install this bundle is to rely on Symfony Flex:

```sh
composer req "spomky-labs/lexik-jose-bridge:^2.0"
```

## Manual Installation

If you do not use Symfony Flex, then use Composer and install the bundle manually.

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/lexik-jose-bridge
```

Then, add this bundle and the `web-token/jwt-framework` bundles into your kernel:

```php
<?php

use Symfony\Component\Config\Loader\LoaderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel;

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            ...
            new Jose\Bundle\JoseFramework\JoseFrameworkBundle(),
            new SpomkyLabs\LexikJoseBundle\SpomkyLabsLexikJoseBundle(),
        ];

        return $bundles;
    }
}
```
